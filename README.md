# FloodIt Game 

Copyright (c) | 2015 | Shuang Wu | University of Waterloo 


It is a text-display Flood-It game I implemented using C++ and MVC pattern for Object Oriented Porgramming course in UW. Flood-It is a one player game which consists of an n√ón-grid of cells, the usual graphical implementation of this game has several colors,but since it is a text display i will use numbers to represent colors.Before the game begins, we specify an initial configuration of the state of cells. Once the cells are configured, the player repeatedly changes the state of the top-left (0,0) cell. In response all neighbouring cells (to the north, south, east, and west) switch state if they were in the same state as a neighbouring cell which changed states. The goal of the game is to have all cells in the grid be in the same state before running out of moves.
